# Introduction to Git

This is a short two-hour training course I use to teach work colleagues the basics of GIT.

It consists of a [markdown file](./gitIntro.md) which is best presented using [markdown presenter](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp).

Once markdown presenter has been installed, the presentation can be launched:

```
./startPresentation.sh
```
